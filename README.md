# exploratory-data-analysis-wine
The data for this exploratory analysis comes from Kaggle and examines wine data scraped from WineEnthusiast during the week of June 15th, 2017.

What are the questions were to be solved?
* what country represents where most the wines in the dataset come from?
* Is there a correlation between price of wine and the points that it is rewarded?
* How many wineries are represented in the dataset? Which winery has the most wines entered?
* what country do the best wines come from? What variety of wine is considered the best(tends to get the most points)?
* how many different varieties are there?
* what wine has the best point score and what is the most expensive wine?
* what is the wine that has the lowest score and what is the cheapest wine on the list?
* what percentage of the wines from each of the countries have a score above 88 points and below 88 points? 
 

Insights obtained throuhgout the project:

As I began exploring and cleaning the dataset scraped from WineEnthusiast, I determined that columns (Unnamed, Description, region_2 and designation) were not needed and therefore removed. I then decided that the best way to showcase the distribution and frequency of wine scores was with a histogram shown below.
